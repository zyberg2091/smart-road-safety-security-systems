### This project consists of two modules:

1. Fraudulent Licence Plate Detection and Alerting System
This involves the use of Computer Vision for licence plate recognition using OpenALPR and OpenCV and it
automatically alerts the user (here, the traffic police and surveillance system) as soon as the licence plate is not
found in the database. This will increase security on the road as the criminals generally use fraudulent licence
plates for committing serious crimes. A lot of crimes can be avoided this way if we automatically detect the
fraudulent licence plates on the road itself.

2. Helmet Detection System
This module again makes use of Computer Vision for Helmet Detection for two wheelers using OpenCV. It
detects whether the rider and the pillion riders are wearing helmets or not and identifies the people who arenâ€™t.
This is a step towards saving numerous lives that are lost due to not wearing helmets.
